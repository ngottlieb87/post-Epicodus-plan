## Post Epicodus Plans

### By Noah Gottlieb


#### Project Plans

* David and I have taken on a project for a friend of mine who is a teacher and would like to have an application. The application will use a classroom currency system with students getting bonuses or fines depending on their behavior and/or accomplishments. Im planning on working on the project and porting the existing project to rails.

* I would like to get back into Angular and specifically Angular 4. I would like to make a card game using the draggable and droppable features with Angular 4.

* Continue working on my portfolio page and implement Ajax for sign in, sign up pages, and displaying comments for projects.

* Continue cleaning up my github and building out existing projects. An example would be to refactor my method for sorting doctor queries and build out styling for the Doctor Api independent project.


#### Future Studies

* Continue studying bubble sort algorithms in Ruby and Js.

* Read the [Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)

* Continue working on Javascript algorithms  on freecodecamp.com

* Learn [Go programming language](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) through [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) and research gems for integration with rails applications.

* Continue learning and building out rails api with Angular/React front end.

*

#### Community Engagement

* Continue going to the Ruby Brigade meetups at New Relic and Epicodus alumni meetups (and other meetups).

* A friend of mine works in Seattle and has worked as a support engineer for Microsoft/Bing and Amazon. He has taken an interest in learning to program and has invited me up to pick his brain and visit his work. I will take up his offer and make concrete plans with him.

* Search github for different projects and make pull requests for issues i can fix.

* Engage with the [learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) community on reddit and give my insights of attending programming bootcamp.
