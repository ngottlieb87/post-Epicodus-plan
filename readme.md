#### Project Plans

1. David and I have taken on a project for a friend of mine who is a teacher and would like to have an application. The application will use a classroom currency system with students getting bonuses or fines depending on their behavior and/or accomplishments. Im planning on working on the project and porting the existing project to rails.

`Rank: 3`
* Continue working on my portfolio page and implement Ajax for sign in, sign up pages, and displaying comments for projects.

* Continue cleaning up my Github and building out existing projects. An example would be to refactor my method for sorting doctor queries and build out styling for the Doctor Api independent project.
`Rank: 5`
* Add sufficient testing to all projects on my Github and use Simplecov(if applicable) and shoot for 100% coverage.

* A friend of mine works in Seattle and has worked as a support engineer for Microsoft/Bing and Amazon. He has taken an interest in learning to program and has invited me up to pick his brain and visit his work. I will take up his offer and make concrete plans with him.
`Rank: 5`
* Search github for different projects and make pull requests for issues i can fix.
`Rank: 3`

`Rank: 3`

### :boom::boom::boom: Action Plan :boom::boom::boom:

*My plan is to stay proactive and treat looking for work as a job itself. I will devote 8 hour days to researching companies to apply to, practicing whiteboard questions, and continue working on projects. Getting Bonilla Bucks (teacher application) out and in use would be a great experience and would look great as a portfolio piece. Connecting with the portland tech community will be a focus outside of the 8 hours and will be achieved by going to meetups, connections through Linkedin, and speaking with Epicodus alumni .*
