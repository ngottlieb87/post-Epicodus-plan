## Post Epicodus Plans

### By Noah Gottlieb


#### Project Plans

* David and I have taken on a project for a friend of mine who is a teacher and would like to have an application. The application will use a classroom currency system with students getting bonuses or fines depending of behavior and/or accomplishments. Im planning on working on the project and porting the existing project to rails.

* I would like to get back into Angular and specifically Angular 4. I would like to make a card game using the draggable and droppable features with Angular 4.

* Continue working on my portfolio page and implement Ajax for sign in, sign up pages, and displaying comments for projects.

#### Future Studies

* Continue studying bubble sort algorithms in Ruby and Js.

* Work on whiteboard interview process.
